# Battleship

A simple battleship game made with Python for command line.

## Summary

A simple command line battleship game for one player made for coding training purposes.

## Background

This game is a simple command line battleship game for one player that is written in Python 3. The player guesses rows and columns to hit the battleship. If the guesses run out, the game ends.

The game saves some statistics about the past games played. The statistics are packed into JSON and saved in separate statistics file. Format can be seen in the statistics_example file.

The game was created mainly for coding training purposes.

## How is it used?

Run on command line with ``python battleship.py`` from the project's main directory.

Requires Python 3.

## What next?

Refactor code.
* Simplify large and complicated methods.
Adding more features to the game.
* Option for multiple battleships with different sizes.
* Board size and number of turns to vary according to number of ships.
* More statistics of past games.
Testing
* Adding tests everywhere where they are sensible.
* Modidify existing code to be testable.
